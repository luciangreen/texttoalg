# texttoalg
Text to Algorithm

Text to Algorithm is a SWI-Prolog algorithm that prepares to breason out file.txt with an algorithm for each word, producing a pastable Shell script file1a.txt, mainly used for postgraduate Pedagogy musings.  Breasoning is thinking of the x, y and z dimensions of objects, necessary for meeting grades.

# Getting Started

Please read the following instructions on how to install the project on your computer for breasoning out algorithms.

# Prerequisites

Please download and install SWI-Prolog for your machine at https://www.swi-prolog.org/build/.

Install List Prolog Interpreter Repository (https://github.com/luciangreen/listprologinterpreter).

Install Text to Breasonings Repository (https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings).

To use this algorithm, you need another window open to develop and test each specification, algorithm and result, before pasting it into texttoalg.


# Installation from List Prolog Package Manager (LPPM)

* Optionally, you can install from LPPM by installing <a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/build/">SWI-Prolog</a> for your machine, downloading the <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/List-Prolog-Package-Manager">LPPM Repository</a>,
```
git clone https://github.com/luciangreen/List-Prolog-Package-Manager.git
cd List-Prolog-Package-Manager
swipl
```
loading LPPM with `['lppm'].` then installing the package by running `lppm_install("luciangreen","texttoalg").`.

# Installing

* Download the repository to your machine.
In the SWI-Prolog environment, enter the following to load the algorithm:
`['../Text-to-Breasonings/text_to_breasonings.pl'].`    
`['texttoalg'].`    

* Enter the following to breason out Breasonings,Breathsonings,Room,PartOfRoom,Direction,ObjectToPrepare and ObjectToFinish. (Note: takes quite a while.)
`texttoalg(u,u,u,u,true,true,true,true,true,true).`    

* Enter the following to breason out the Breasonings and Breathsonings:
`texttoalg(u,u,u,u,true,false,false,false,false,false).`    

* Before running texttobr, think of two radio buttons put on recordings, put through with prayer, nut and bolt, quantum box prayer 1, 1, 0.5 cm and 1, 1, 0.5 cm.

* Follow instructions in https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings/blob/master/Instructions_for_Using_texttobr(2).pl.txt when using texttoalg, texttobr, or texttobr2 to avoid medical problems.

* Before breasoning, breason out algdict1.txt and algdict2.txt to allow breasoning multiple instances by dragging them from Finder (Mac) to empty BBEdit window for file.txt, then enter:
`['../Text-to-Breasonings/text_to_breasonings.pl'].`
`texttobr2(u,u,u,u,true,false,false,false,false,false),texttobr(u,u,u,u).`

* Not recommended (due to idiosyncrasies of Shell, so breasoning out the dictionaries in the previous step may have to suffice): Copy and paste contents of file1a.txt into Terminal window (Mac) (one to a few lines at a time) to breason out algorithms for all instances of words.
